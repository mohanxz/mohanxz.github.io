                <p class="lead">Hi! I’m Mohan Raj, a passionate Frontend Developer, and I love transforming bold ideas into seamless and interactive web experiences. Whether it's a personal blog, an online store, or a complex web application, my goal is to bring your vision to life on the web.</p>
                
                <h2 class="h4 mt-5">What is Web Development?</h2>
                <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and applications that run on the internet. It’s like building a digital version of your ideas, where users can interact, engage, and explore. Imagine you have a great concept—a place where people can shop, learn, or connect. Web development is what turns that concept into a working website that anyone can visit and use.</p>

                <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Web development involves two main parts:</h3>
                
                <h4 class="h6 mt-3"><strong>1. Front-End Development (The Visual Side)</strong></h4>
                <p>When you visit a website, the front-end is what you see and interact with. It includes the layout, colors, fonts, buttons, images, and everything else that makes up the visual part of a website. As a front-end developer, I focus on making sure the website looks great and works smoothly across all devices—whether it’s on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Think of it as designing the "face" of the website that users see.</p>
                
                <h4 class="h6 mt-3"><strong>2. Back-End Development (The Behind-the-Scenes Work)</strong></h4>
                <p>Behind every website, there's a lot going on that you don’t see. The back-end is responsible for how the website works. It handles things like storing data, processing information, and managing user accounts. The back-end makes sure that when you click a button, the website responds correctly. It’s like the engine of a car—it powers everything, even though you don’t see it.</p>
                
                <h2 class="h4 mt-5">How I Approach Web Development</h2>
                <p>When I create a website, I believe in blending creativity with functionality. I focus on building websites that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and efficient. My goal is to ensure that every visitor to your website has a seamless experience, whether they’re browsing on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.</p>
                
                <p>Here's how I approach each project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Understanding Your Vision:</strong> Before I start coding, I take the time to understand your ideas, goals, and target audience. This helps me create a website that reflects your brand and meets your needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design with Purpose:</strong> I craft designs that are both beautiful and functional. The layout, colors, and typography are all chosen to enhance the user experience and make your website stand out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean and Responsive Code:</strong> I write clean, efficient code that ensures your website works perfectly on all devices. I make sure the site is fast, secure, and easy to maintain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Collaboration:</strong> Throughout the development process, I keep you in the loop. Your feedback is essential, and I make adjustments based on your input to make sure you’re happy with the final product.</li>
                </ul>
